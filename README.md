# Decision-Tree
Built and evaluated a decision tree model using City of Dallas Building Permit data (1970–2024) to classify Commercial, Multi-Family, and Single-Family permits. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization with Pandas and Plotly, achieving an F1 score of 0.70 (weighted). Identified class imbalance and overlapping features as key model limitations.
